    I am from Jammu region of J and K ( Union Territory).I did my secondary schooling from Jammu.Till my 10th standard, I was in Convent School and I did my 12th standard from a public school in Jammu.There I live
    in Village named Bhatyari, which is quite peaceful area , with greenery all around. I had deep interest in Computers and new technology and this brought me here at College Of Engineering Pune as a Computer Science Student. I have a vast experience of hacking and playing around the tech, experimenting new things always and I am always working on some project or the other everytime.
